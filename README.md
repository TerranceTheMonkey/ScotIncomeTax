Analysis of Taxable Income Elasticities in Scotland 

This code stored in this repository relates to a paper written by Bruce Golding.  The paper is saved here as â€œMeasuring Behavioural Response to Changes in Income Tax Policy in Scotland"

The analysis contained in this paper uses data from the 2014/15 Survey of Personal incomes: Public Use Tapes (SPI).  The data is available from the UK Data Service: http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8239-1

The code uses the SPI data in tabular format.  It also requires the creation of a file based on Annex B of the SPI.  This is required because the data from some strata had to be aggregated to maintain the privacy of the taxpayers involved.  See the release notes with the data for more on this.  The required Annex B file is a csv with three variables:  SREF, SCOTSHARE, RUKSHARE.  The SCOTSHARE and RUKSHARE variables are the share of each composite record listed in Annex B that is from Scotland and the rest of the UK. This file needs to be created and added to working directory for the first script to work and all the other scripts depend on it.  

There are 9 R scripts in this repository.  They were originally run on R version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18) -- "World-Famous Astronaut".  
1. Import and Fix -
      Imports data from tabular file and csv (Annex B).  Creates many derived variables. All the following scripts require this to be run first.  
2. Data Checks -
      Produces a series of summaries of the checks comparing derived variables with those found in the dataset
3. Summary Stats -
      Produces a series of tables and graphs summarising the data  
4. Deductions -
    Weights up the individual deductions, exemptions and tax credits to be nationally representative. 
5. Naive Analysis -
    Results in Section 4.2 of the paper
6. Income Analysis -
    Results in Section 4.3 of the paper    
7. Gender Analysis -
    Results in Section 4.4 of the paper
8. Director Analysis -
    Results in Section 4.5 of the paper
9. Frictions Analysis -
    Results in Section 4.6 of the paper

The following conventions apply to naming variables:
-Variables that end XX are built from components those that don't were in the original dataset, for example TII is total investment income which was given in the original dataset; TIIXX is total investment income calculated by adding 
-Variables that end ZZ calculate the difference between derived and given variables for example TIIZZ = TII - TIIXX
-Variables that begin PF_ are tests of whether derived and given variables match
